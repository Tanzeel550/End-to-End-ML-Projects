These are my machine learning projects, named after the name of Algorithm used in that project.\n
Linear Regression: This is the project which predicts the amount of alcohol a student consumes in one week depending upon various factors.
Logistic Regression: This is the project which predicts that a person either has chance of having heart attack or he is free.
